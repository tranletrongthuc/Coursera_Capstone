    "My city is very big. People move from the countryside to my city more in the last several years. Besides that, there are not too many wide roads with a parking lot on the roadside. Therefore, it's not easy to find out a parking lot in the urban for cars. As usual, people have to book a parking lot about 30-60 minutes before arriving, sometimes even 6 hours in at a rush hour. If unlucky, they have to park too far away. "
